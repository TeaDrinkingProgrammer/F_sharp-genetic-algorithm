# F_sharp-genetic-algorithm
For my minor-AI, one of the excersises was to make a genetic algorithm, presumably in Python. I chose to make to make one in F# as part of the mandatory "free choice excersise". I chose to use F# because it seemed like a good fit and because I wanted to get back into functional programming again.
